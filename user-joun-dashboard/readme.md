### CSV Format Example

```csv
analyticsid,userid,deviceid,category,name,datetimeutc
1,12345,device-ios-123,app_event,open_SplashScreen,2025-09-01 10:00:00
2,12345,device-ios-123,app_event,open_HomeScreen,2025-09-01 10:00:15

## Configuration Options

### Session Settings
- **Session Timeout**: Adjust the time gap (10-60 minutes) that defines a new session
- Default: 30 minutes

### User Flow Settings
- **Top Screens**: Control how many screens appear in the Sankey diagram (5-15)
- **Min Users per Flow**: Set minimum users threshold for displayed paths (10-200)

### Date Range Filters
- Last 7 Days
- Last 30 Days
- Last 90 Days
- All Time

## Key Fixes in This Version

### 1. ‚úÖ Timezone Issue Resolved
**Problem**: `TypeError: Cannot subtract tz-naive and tz-aware datetime-like objects`

**Solution**: All datetime objects are now converted to timezone-naive format using:
```python
df['datetimeutc'] = pd.to_datetime(df['datetimeutc'], errors='coerce', utc=True).dt.tz_localize(None)
current_time = pd.Timestamp.now().tz_localize(None)
```

### 2. ‚úÖ Improved Sankey Diagram
**Problems**: 
- Too cluttered and hard to read
- Overlapping labels
- Too many flows

**Solutions**:
- Limited to top N screens (configurable, default 10)
- Shows only first 3 events per user for clarity
- Filters out low-volume transitions
- Simplified screen names (removes 'open_', 'Screen', 'click_' prefixes)
- Added user-configurable parameters in sidebar
- Better color scheme and hover information
- Larger, more readable diagram (700px height)

### 3. ‚úÖ Enhanced Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing columns
- Better error messages
- Fallback options for empty datasets

### Machine Learning Components

1. **K-Means Clustering**: Segments users into 4 groups based on:
   - Total sessions
   - Average session duration
   - Total events
   - Days active

2. **Isolation Forest**: Detects anomalous user behavior based on:
   - Event frequency
   - Session patterns

### Performance Optimizations

- **Caching**: `@st.cache_data` decorator for expensive operations
- **Lazy Loading**: Data processed only when needed
- **Efficient Aggregations**: Pandas groupby operations
- **Limited Data Display**: Top N results and pagination

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Dashboard doesn't load data
- **Solution**: Check CSV file format matches requirements
- Ensure datetime column exists and is properly formatted

**Issue**: Sankey diagram is empty
- **Solution**: Lower the "Min Users per Flow" threshold in sidebar
- Ensure you have enough data (at least 100 events)

**Issue**: Memory errors with large files
- **Solution**: Process data in chunks or filter by date range
- Consider sampling large datasets

**Issue**: Segmentation not working
- **Solution**: Ensure you have at least 20 users
- Check that all required metrics columns exist

## Best Practices

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Clean your data before upload
   - Ensure consistent datetime formats
   - Remove duplicate events

2. **Performance**:
   - Start with smaller date ranges for initial exploration
   - Use filters to focus on specific user segments
   - Export large datasets for offline analysis

3. **Analysis**:
   - Compare metrics across different time periods
   - Segment users before analyzing behavior
   - Cross-reference anomalies with external events
