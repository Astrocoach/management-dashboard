## Critical Issue Identified and Resolved

### üîç Problem Discovery
**Initial Issue:** Only 567 out of 85,042 rows (0.67%) were being processed due to datetime parsing failures.

### üîß Root Cause Analysis
The data contained **two different datetime formats**:

1. **adapty_event** (567 rows): ISO format with timezone
   ```
   2025-09-02T09:08:07.875Z
   ```

2. **app_event** (84,475 rows): Simple datetime format
   ```
   2025-09-23 09:00:39
   ```

### üí° Solution Implemented
Enhanced the datetime parsing logic in `main.py` to handle both formats:

```python
# First attempt: Parse with UTC (for ISO format with timezone)
df['datetimeutc'] = pd.to_datetime(df['datetimeutc'], errors='coerce', utc=True)

# Second attempt: Parse failed entries without timezone assumption
failed_mask = df['datetimeutc'].isnull()
if failed_mask.any():
    original_df = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
    failed_values = original_df.loc[failed_mask, 'datetimeutc']
    parsed_without_tz = pd.to_datetime(failed_values, errors='coerce')
    df.loc[failed_mask, 'datetimeutc'] = parsed_without_tz
```

### ‚úÖ Results After Fix
| Metric | Before Fix | After Fix |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Successfully Parsed** | 567 (0.67%) | 85,042 (100%) |
| **Data Loss** | 84,475 rows | 0 rows |
| **Date Range Coverage** | Limited | 2025-09-02 to 2025-09-30 |
